    "\n",
    "`Supervised ML is used to predict values/outcomes`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commonly used in industry\n",
    "- Easy to implement ml model\n",
    "\n",
    "__Overview__:\n",
    "We give a ml model data and tell it what the correct outputs are. There are two major types of supervised learning: `Classification` and `Regression`. Each has their own version of \"correct output\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Classification\n",
    "In Classification problems, the correct ouput represents a __`label`__. The label represents a group of observations that are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "`In Plain English`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is this a fruit or a vegetable?\n",
    "- Is this a Gala Apple or a Granny Smith Apple?\n",
    "- Is it raining or not raining?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of questions we try to answer using Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Binary Classification` - Exactly 2 classes/groups\n",
    "- Does this new observation belong to group 1 or group 2?\n",
    "- Is this email that says \"You've inherited a large sum of money from a Nigerian Prince respond ASAP to claim!!!!\" a spam email, or a legitimate email?\n",
    "- Churn or not churn?\n",
    "- _Yes or No type questions_\n",
    "\n",
    "`Multiclass Classification` - More than 2 classes/groups\n",
    "- Who are my customers? (age, sex, zip code, education, occupation, current salary) - Targeted Marketing Campaigns\n",
    "- Is this Iris a Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _How_ does our do this? Magic -> Features of our dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification tasks use labeled targets. This means that for each record in a dataset, there is a label defining what the row of features means/is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the Iris dataset's two seperate data frames.\n",
    "1. Feature data\n",
    "- There are 4 features [4 columns] for each Iris: Petal length/width and Sepal length/width.\n",
    "    > Using the number of features with the number of records [irises] we get the dimensions (150, 4) row x column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Target data\n",
    "- The target, what the record of features is called/labeled, is a single column with 3 distinct values 0, 1, 2. Each representing a species of Iris.\n",
    "    > We can't give the supervised ml model the actual label 'Setosa', because it doesn't \"understand\" what a Setosa is. We have to speak the model's language and translate it back to human language using our own encoding/decoding methods. In Classification, this is not difficult. A number is used to group records together into the same class. As in the Iris dataset: 0 = Setosas, 1 = Versicolours, 2= Virginicas. Each number groups together 50 observations. Hence the dimensions of the 'target' data (150,).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. Iris dataset - Features:[] - inputs, Species - output\n",
    "\n",
    "We want ml models to generalize and predict a 'target' when given records/observations outside of the training/validation/test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning requires data collection, cleaning, and wrangling. Once a dataset is prepared [data/target pair the supervised ml model trains on] then the supervised ml model can extract insight from the data."
